# Overview

I wrote a program which makes use of common elements in programming using Kotlin.
It involves an object with attributes and methods, an If statements, loops and nullability handling.
It is really intuitive and easy to understand.

My purpose for writing this code was to show my ability to create a kotling program which runs and uses common programming procedures.
